# Project 3 
## Versions of Python packages 
There are three available envornments, use env_nn.txt when running the notebooks; LinearRegression.ipynb,  	NeuralNetworks_1timestep.ipynb, NeuralNetworks_7days.ipynb and NeuralNetworks_1timestep_logit.ipynb. The enviornments tflow.txt is for the notebooks; tensorflow_nn.ipynb and tensorflow_nn_different_results.ipynb. The notebooks trees_7days.ipynb and trees_t0.ipynb. We underline that these enviornments are different and that they are used on different operationssystems. The invormation on how to create an evirnment and which platform it run on can be found in the first lines in the txt-file.

## Abstract



## Structure and implementations
The programs are written inn python scrips and the results are produced in the notebooks. Writing these article produced a lot of results, we found it best to use many notebooks to keep a good order. 

deepNN.py contains the program for our self-implemented neural network. This is a implroved version of project 2 ann.py, this version is improved to build networks with different numbers of nodes and number of hidden layers. The code for using linear regression has been updated with a normalization of the response.
