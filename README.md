# Project 3 
## Versions of Python packages 
There are three available envornments, use env_nn.txt when running the notebooks; LinearRegression.ipynb,  	NeuralNetworks_1timestep.ipynb, NeuralNetworks_7days.ipynb and NeuralNetworks_1timestep_logit.ipynb. The enviornments tflow.txt is for the notebooks; tensorflow_nn.ipynb and tensorflow_nn_different_results.ipynb. The notebooks trees_7days.ipynb and trees_t0.ipynb. We underline that these enviornments are different and that they are used on different operationssystems. The invormation on how to create an evirnment and which platform it run on can be found in the first lines in the txt-file.
